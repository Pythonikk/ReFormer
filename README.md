# ReFormer

This project was an assignment from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-forms). The primary goal was to understand how to use Rails' form helpers, which I did here through a simple form to create a new user and edit an existing user. The secondary goal was to succesffully display validation errors in the views.

The project was set up to have us begin by creating an 'old fashioned' html form with label and input tags, then 'upgrade' to a more railsy way with the form_tag and input-type tag helpers (this method is soft-depreciated as of this project), and to finally use Rails' form_with block for the final version. This was helpful in understanding exactly what Rails is performing behind the scenes.
